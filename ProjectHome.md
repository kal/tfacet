tFacet applies known interaction concepts to allow hierarchical faceted exploration of RDF data. The aim is to facilitate ordinary users to formulate semantically unambiguous queries so as to support the fast and precise access to information. Used interaction concepts are e.g. a directory tree and interchangeable columns that are already well-known from other applications. The directory tree, for example, is used to enable the intuitive exploration and selection of hierarchical facets. tFacet is based on the open source framework Adobe Flex and uses SPARQL to access RDF datasets.

To build tFacet, you will need the [Flex Framework](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Downloads) (version 4.5 or higher). A Flex IDE such as [Flashdevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org) or the [Adobe Flash Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html) is recommended.
